        <h1>V Rising's Animation Layering in Unity</h1>
        <h4>Albin Thunström - Technical Animator at Stunlock Studios</h4>
        <p>
            Animation Layering - when you want your Call of Duty soldier running around and reloading at the same time without skipping a step. You play your running animation on the pelvis and down, and your gun related animations on the torso and up. Easy-peasy, right? Well, it’s not always that simple. What happens when you want to combine running with swinging a sword? And what if you want to be able to use the same animations for when your character is running as for when they’re standing still? 
            <br><br>I’ll show you how we handled these problems in V Rising. While our game is made in Unity, our solution was actually inspired by an Unreal Engine live training video, which goes to show how sharing an idea or a concept can have an impact that you never anticipated, and how beneficial doing so is for our industry. So this is me paying it forward. While Unreal solved this issue with special Unreal specific animation nodes, we solved it in Unity through clever use of character rigs, real-time IK, and nested blend trees.
